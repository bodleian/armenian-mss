Structure:

- [collections](collections/) contains the TEI P5 manuscript description files
- [processing](processing/) contains scripts to convert or process them
- [authority](authority/) contains local authority files which determine what is indexed (and how) on the web site
- [archive](working/) contains a copy of the TEI files before conversion

Documentation for cataloguing and maintaining authority files will be made available shortly.
